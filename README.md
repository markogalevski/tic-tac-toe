# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe (i.e. noughts and crosses) browser game!

The main goal of this project, according to TOP, is to focus on 
encapsulating data and hiding object internals from other objects
as much as possible.

The main thing I've learned is the joy of the magic of closure based functions.
Combining these with IIFEs to create private variables that don't have to 
be marked as such!? Fun times.

## Development
Install dependencies (one off): `pnpm install`.
`pnpm dev` will start your dev server at `http://localhost:5173`.
